Please learn and think according to the provided Context. \n Context: \n document (1) \n\n Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release  (ECTR) refers to a method of performing carpal tunnel surgery using an endoscope or an arthroscopic device to provide visualization of the anatomic structures. Endoscopic techniques for carpal tunnel release involve one or two smaller incisions (less than half inch each) through which instrumentation is introduced including a synovial elevator, probes, knives, and an endoscope used to visualize the underside of the transverse carpal ligament. The endoscopic methods do not divide the subcutaneous tissues or the palmar fascia to the same degree as the open method does. Many studies have been done to determine whether the perceived benefits of a limited endoscopic or arthroscopic release are significant. Many surgeons have embraced limited incision methods. It is considered to be the procedure of choice for many of these surgeons with respect to idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome. Supporting this are the results of some of the previously mentioned series that cite no difference in the rate of complications for either method of surgery. Thus, there has been broad support for either surgical procedure using a variety of devices or incisions.\n\n \n\nQuestion: A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take? \n Options:  <A> Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report. <B> Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake. <C> Report the physician to the ethics committee. <D> Refuse to dictate the operative report.   \n Select an option from the provided Options <A>, <B>, <C>, <D> to answer the given Question. The selected answer is <____________'
